Short-Form Film Market Entry Strategy

Objective: Identify High-Performing Film Types

With major players entering the original video content space, our company aims to strategically position itself in the short-form film industry. To guide this venture, we conducted an analysis of critically acclaimed short films to determine which genres and film types are most successful at the box office.

We focused on four core performance metrics:
â€¢	 IMDb Rating
â€¢	 Tomatometer Score
â€¢	 Audience Score
â€¢	 Box Office Revenue.

Each of these metrics serves as a proxy for public reception and commercial potential, allowing us to recommend data-backed strategies for entry into the market.

 Data Preparation and Genre Focus.
 
To ensure high-quality insights:
â€¢	We cleaned the dataset by converting raw Box Office figures into usable numerical formats.
â€¢	Genres were simplified by extracting the primary genre from complex multi-genre entries.

Key discovery:
Genres such as Animation, Short, and Drama were the most prevalent among high-performing titles. These categories form a strategic foundation for initial studio content planning.

Audience and Critic Agreement:

A notable insight was the strong correlation between IMDb Ratings and Audience Scores.
This alignment indicates that:
â€¢	Audience and critical perception are closely matched.
â€¢	These scores are reliable indicators of content quality.
â€¢	Films with high ratings in both metrics also tend to show better box office performance.

This reinforces the importance of creating content that satisfies both critics and general audiences.

Visual Insights and Genre Trends:

We leveraged Tableau to create interactive visuals.
Key findings:
â€¢	Animated films consistently performed well across ratings and revenue.
â€¢	Year-over-year trends show consistent success, making Animation a low-risk, high-reward entry point for new content producers.

Comparative Genre Performance
Using box plots and distribution visuals:

â€¢	We observed high variance in genres like Drama and Comedy â€” with occasional blockbusters but also frequent underperformers.
â€¢	Animation stood out as the most consistent and dependable genre.
â€¢	This makes it an ideal choice for studios aiming for predictable results and positive reception in the early stages.

Recommendations for the New Studio

Based on our findings, we recommend:
â€¢	Start with Animated Short Films
Emphasize emotional or humorous storytelling to attract broad audience appeal.
â€¢	Optimize for Ratings and Reviews
Aim to create content that performs well both critically and commercially.
â€¢	Leverage Visual Trends
Continue using analytics platforms (e.g., Tableau) to track what works and iterate accordingly.
â€¢	Adapt to Feedback Loops
Maintain ongoing feedback mechanisms from both internal reviews and public response to continuously refine your strategy.
